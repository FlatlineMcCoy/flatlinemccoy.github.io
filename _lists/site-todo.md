Things I want to add to this site

1. lightbox / photoswipe gallery where no matter how many images there are in a gallery, it appears on the page as a single row of images. When you click on an image, it opens up the full gallery in a lightbox.
2. list of books
3. list of movies
4. some way to organize and display my browser bookmarks, with nested heirarchy of folders
5. figure out the "SystemStackError" that happens when local server is runnning w/ livereload and it gets to the jekyll feed step.
