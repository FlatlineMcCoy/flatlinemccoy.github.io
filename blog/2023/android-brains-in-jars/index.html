whole-brain connectome of an adult female fruit fly.</p> <ul> <li>120,000+ Neurons</li> <li>30,000,000+ Synapses</li> <li>100,000+ Annotations</li> </ul> <p>A connectome is a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain, and may be thought of as its “wiring diagram.” The fruit fly is one commonly used model organisms in neuroscience and biology research. It’s in the superstar pantheon of scientific model organisms, along with the mouse, zebrafish, and nematode worm. Drosophila has a smaller brain vs. mammals but can still form memories, learn, and engage in complex social behavior. Hence findings from studies in fruit flies’ brains can often be applied to other animals, including humans.</p> <p>The story of FlyWire’s creation is an interesting one, combining gamification, AI, and crowdsourced science. First, the brain was sectioned and imaged with an electron microscope, then AI took the first pass at identifying the 120k+ individual neurons and 30m+ individual connections. However, the AI’s output wasn’t perfect. Certain synapses were incorrectly linked, or grouped with incorrect neurons. Human annotation was needed, but the scale was immense. So researchers created a <a href="http://edit.flywire.ai" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">game-like interface</a> for crowdsourcing edits and annotations to the initial AI output. “Players” search for the right pieces and put together beautiful 3D neurons that advance science’s understanding of brain circuits.</p> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/flybrain-eyes.mp4" class="img-fluid z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls=""></video> <figcaption class="caption">All neurons and synapses of the fly's eye</figcaption> </figure> <p>The end result is a masterpiece in crowdsourced science. The potential benefits of such a resource are immense - we can now make significant advances in our understanding of how the brain works by ultimately linking neuronal wiring with brain function. Personally, I find the images and videos that came out of it are quite beautiful in their own right.</p> <p>I came across the FlyWire project during my daily browsing of HackerNews. Anytime I see something vaguely relevant for my work at <a href="https://openbci.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenBCI</a> that has broken through to more “mainstream” tech audiences like HackerNews, I make a note and usually end up adding it to our social media pipeline. This time, down in the comments section there was a link to a short story called <a href="https://qntm.org/mmacevedo" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lena by qtnm</a>. Basically, <em>Lena</em> is about what happens when we do to the human brain, what FlyWire has done to the fruit fly.</p> <p>It’s written in the style of a wikipedia article from the future on the topic of <strong>MMAcevedo</strong> also known as Miguel, the earliest executable image of a human brain. A brain-in-an-exe copy of Miguel Acevedo Álvarez which heralded the dawn of the “workloading” industry, where virtual machines running virtual humans could be spun up to do the work of thousands of humans. The story came out in Jan 2021, long before the ChatGPT hypetrain left the station and generated a corresponding tsunami of white-collared existential dread. This style of anthropological or encyclopedic world-building has always interested me. When it’s done well, it shows the author had gone a level deeper into the world they’re building, and it makes the story that much more believable. Ursula K. LeGuin’s <em>Haimish</em> works are the best example of this that I’ve come across.</p> <p>The story is a quick read, full excellent quotes. Pulling out a few here:</p> <blockquote> <p>In 2049 it became known that MMAcevedo was being widely shared and experimented upon without Acevedo’s permission. Acevedo’s attempts to curtail this proliferation had the opposite of the intended effect. A series of landmark U.S. court decisions found that Acevedo did not have the right to control how his brain image was used, with the result that MMAcevedo is now by far the most widely distributed, frequently copied, and closely analysed human brain image.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Acevedo died from coronary heart failure in 2073 at the age of 62. It is estimated that copies of MMAcevedo have lived a combined total of more than 152,000,000,000 subjective years in emulation. If illicit, modified copies of MMAcevedo are counted, this figure increases by an order of magnitude.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>As the earliest viable brain scan, MMAcevedo is one of a very small number of brain scans to have been recorded before widespread understanding of the hazards of uploading and emulation. MMAcevedo not only predates all industrial scale virtual image workloading but also the KES case, the Whitney case, the Seafront Experiments and even Poulsen’s pivotal and prescient Warnings paper. Though speculative fiction on the topic of uploading existed at the time of the MMAcevedo scan, relatively little of it made accurate exploration of the possibilities of the technology. That fiction which did was far less widely-known than it is today and Acevedo was certainly not familiar with it at the time of his uploading.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>As such, unlike the vast majority of emulated humans, the emulated Miguel Acevedo boots with an excited, pleasant demeanour. He is eager to understand how much time has passed since his uploading, what context he is being emulated in, and what task or experiment he is to participate in.</p> <p>...</p> <p>MMAcevedo’s demeanour and attitude contrast starkly with those of nearly all other uploads taken of modern adult humans, most of which boot into a state of disorientation which is quickly replaced by terror and extreme panic. Standard procedures for securing the upload’s cooperation such as red-washing, blue-washing, and use of the Objective Statement Protocols are unnecessary.</p> </blockquote> <p>A few lines stood out to me and sparked a connection to another famous work of neurosci-fi, William Gibson’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Neuromancer</a>.</em></p> <blockquote> <p>MMAcevedo is considered by some to be the “first immortal”, and by others to be a profound warning of the horrors of immortality.</p> <p>...</p> <p>The biological Acevedo was initially extremely protective of his uploaded image and guarded its usage carefully. Towards the end of his life, as it became possible to run simulated humans in banks of millions at hundred-fold time compression, Acevedo indicated that being uploaded had been the greatest mistake of his life, and <strong>expressed a wish to permanently delete all copies of MMAcevedo.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>This last line, and the idea of digital brain-scan immortality is what made me start thinking of Neuromancer. One of my favorite characters in Gibson’s novel is the digital ghost of the legendary hacker McCoy Pauley, aka the Dixie Flatline. Pauley was a legendary hacker who died of a brain aneurysm while attempting to crack an AI. His brain was scanned and his consciousness was uploaded into a ROM construct, which was then used as a hacking tool by Case, the protagonist of the novel.</p> <p><strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong><br> Towards the end of the book,</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2023 Joseph Artuso.
