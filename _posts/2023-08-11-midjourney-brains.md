I had fun spending an afternoon exploring Midjourney. Using the OpenBCI Ultracortex product image as an input produced some good images. I'm pleased with the results. I think it's wild that it's primary UI is via Discord. 

<div class="grid">
<div class="grid-sizer">
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="{{ "assets/img/midjourney-brains/1.jpg" | relative_url}}" alt=""></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="{{ "assets/img/midjourney-brains/2.jpg" | relative_url}}" alt=""></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="{{ "assets/img/midjourney-brains/3.jpg" | relative_url}}" alt=""></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="{{ "assets/img/midjourney-brains/4.jpg" | relative_url}}" alt=""></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="{{ "assets/img/midjourney-brains/5.jpg" | relative_url}}" alt=""></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="{{ "assets/img/midjourney-brains/6.jpg" | relative_url}}" alt=""></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="{{ "assets/img/midjourney-brains/7.jpg" | relative_url}}" alt=""></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><img src="{{ "assets/img/midjourney-brains/8.jpg" | relative_url}}" alt=""></div>
</div>
</div>
